Major rewrite of the Vim syntax file and plugin enhancements

This patch is a major rewrite of the Vim syntax file
(vim/syntax/mercury.vim), supporting following (optional) features:
 - highlighting of foreign code, including all doubly escaped characters
   such as "" or \\" in strings, etc.
 - recognising \uXXXX \OOO\ and formatting specifiers in Mercury strings
 - concealing of certain operators and infix functions such as /\,
   the `compose` function from std_util,
   and set-calculus related operators (`union`, ...)
 - supporting markup within comments, i.e. as function headers, `  ',
   ``'', URIs and Mercury file names, TODO, NOTE, XXX and so on.
 - support underlining of local variables within function or predicate
   bodies, which is a feature found in SWI-Prolog.
   Additionally one can use <C-K>r and <C-K>R to rename the underlined
   variable.
 - improved speed due to better overlong line detection and a sync on
   Mercury line comments '%-----' instead of sync start, which is
   noticeable for large files such as io.m.
 - Different way of supporting transparent comment highlighting, such
   that spell checking works only on comments in both fully highlighted
   and partially highlighted comments, this works best if comment
   markup is enables (see above).
   Without this, spell checking would have to be enabled for Mercury
   code as well which Vim is not good at.
 - Improved folding support if no user defined setting is in place
 - Matching parenthesis detection (here meaning (),[],{}) and marking
   unbalanced parens as err
 - highlighting of spurious whitespace for better patch management.
