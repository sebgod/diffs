Remove jar index creation for library jars

In compiler/compile_target_code.m it is stated that creating a jar index with
"jar -i <jarfile>" speeds up class loading. This is only true for
executable jars with jars defined in their manifest file classpath.
For jars created by the Mercury compiler (so far only libraries), there
will always be only one entry (the jar file itself).
Under Linux using Java 7+ and installing Mercury using "sudo make install",
e.g. for installing under /usr/local, invoking "jar -i <jarfile>" will create
a temporary file with root owner and chmod 0600, thus making it inaccessible
from an unprivileged mmc process.

compiler/compile_target_code.m:
    Modify create_java_archive to not create a jar index.
    Also modify compare_file_timestamps/5 to avoid a race condition
    (file access violations) which occurs under Windows when comparing
    a file with itself. Here a file always compares compares 'yes(=)' if
    A and B are identical.
