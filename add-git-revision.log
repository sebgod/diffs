Record the git revision the Mercury compiler was compiled with

It can be useful to check the git revision from which the Mercury compiler was 
compiled from.

compiler/handle_options.m:
    In display_compiler_version/2 write out the git revision the compiler was
    compiled from.

configure.ac:
    define GIT_REVISION macro and collect git describe output,
    also define MR_GIT_REVISION in lieu of MR_VERSION.

library/library.m:
    Move version/2 to version/3 and also output the git revision of the
    compiler. Make version/2 a wrapper for version/3 by ignoring the
    git revision output.

java/runtime/Constants.java.in:
library/erlang_conf.hrl.in:
runtime/mercury_conf.h.in:
runtime/mercury_dotnet.cs.in:
    Add the grade specific MR_GIT_REVISION constant.
