Fix mfiltercc gcc output filtering

While trying to figure out why util/mfiltercc is not filtering that gcc
`used but undefined' messages on Windows using either cmd.exe or
the msys shell, I noticed that command redirection is handled
differently on the win32 platform.
So just removing the use_win32 specific code in compiler/module_cmds.m
and building the compiler itself and all other Mercury programs I did
not notice any observable difference besides the correct filtering of
that gcc warning.

Remove Windows specific error redirection handling to enable the
mfiltercc functionality.

compiler/module_cmds.m:
    see above.
